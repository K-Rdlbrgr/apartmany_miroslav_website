# Website for Apártmany a štúdiá Miroslav
This repository contains a Django project for a touristic website for apartments and studios in Demänovská Dolina, Slovakia.

The final website is supposed to contain four different languages, contact and reservation forms and a review system for the guestbook.

And in case you are on the search for a great place to stay for your next holidays, really check Miroslav's apartments out. It's a great basecamp to either ski in winter or hike and explore Slovakia's beautiful nature all around the year! 🏔☀️
